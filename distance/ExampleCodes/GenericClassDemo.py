    """This class defines a generic type-safe mechanism for associating
    additional data with an object (without modifying the original
    object via subclassing or monkey-patching).

    It was originally designed to avoid monkey-patching the Django
    HttpRequest object, to which we want to associate computed state
    (e.g. parsed state computed from the User-Agent) so that it's
    available in code paths that receive the HttpRequest object.

    The implementation uses a WeakKeyDictionary, so that the notes
    object will be garbage-collected when the original object no
    longer has other references (avoiding memory leaks).

    We still need to be careful to avoid any of the attributes of
    _DataT having points to the original object, as that can create a
    cyclic reference cycle that the Python garbage collect may not
    handle correctly.
